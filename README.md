<b>nRF5 SDK v16.0.0</b> 


The nRF5 SDK provides a rich developing environment for nRF5 Series devices by including a broad selection of drivers, libraries, examples for peripherals, SoftDevices, and proprietary radio protocols.

The SDK is delivered as a plain .zip-archive, which makes it easy to install as well as giving you the freedom to choose the IDE and compiler of your choice.

All code examples included in the SDK are tailored to compile for and run on Nordic Semiconductor's nRF5 Development Kits.
